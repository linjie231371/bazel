# Custom rules
Skylark is the name of the extension mechanism in Bazel. It lets you write
[custom build rules](rules.html) as well as compose existing ones into
[macros](macros.html).


## Getting started

Read the [concepts](concepts.md) behind Skylark and try the
[cookbook examples](cookbook.md). To go further, read about the
[standard library](lib/globals.html).
